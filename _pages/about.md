<div align="justify"> I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Vigo in the Department of Mathematics. My research focuses on the field of algebraic topology and its intersection with combinatorial dynamics, exploring the interaction between both areas and their applications. </div> <br/>



<div align="justify"> In particular, my research consists of two main interwoven lines. On one hand, I work in Morse Theory (both discrete and differentiable) and investigate certain homotopy and homology invariants, such as homotopy distance, topological complexity, Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category, or covering type from a more computational approach. To this end, I use cellular, simplicial, homological, and dynamical techniques. On the other hand, I strive not to limit myself to the study of invariants of spaces and objects, but to investigate invariants of maps or morphisms (recovering the original invariants as a particular case) to obtain new results about the former and a deeper understanding of the relationships between them. Examples of this approach include the introduction of homotopy distance (jointly with E. Macías-Virgós) and Lefschetz calculus -preprint- (jointly with A.O. Majadas-Moure). </div> <br/>



<div align="justify"> Recently, I have started exploring applications of algebraic topology and combinatorial dynamics in information aggregation problems. </div>

<div align="justify"> In addition to my research and teaching activities, I have been collaborating in the organization of the Galician stage of the Spanish Mathematical Olympiad (OME) since 2018 and in the final Spanish stage in 2019. Since 2024, I have been part of the Galician delegation. I also participate in the Estalmat program, serve as a jury member for research initiation awards (such as the Stephen Hawking prize), and engage in mathematical outreach events for the general public. </div>
